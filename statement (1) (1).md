# Project Statement

## Problem Statement

Managing road traffic efficiently is a major challenge in urban areas.
Determining the optimal route from one location to another based on road
connections and distances is essential for reducing congestion, saving
time, and improving navigation. This project aims to simulate a
small-scale road traffic routing system using graph-based search
algorithms to find the best possible paths.

## Scope of the Project

-   The project focuses on implementing fundamental pathfinding
    algorithms.
-   It handles a predefined road map represented as a graph.
-   It compares BFS, DFS, and A\* algorithms to show differences in
    pathfinding behavior.
-   It serves as an educational demonstration rather than a real-world
    GPS application.

## Target Users

-   Students learning algorithms and graph theory.
-   Beginners practicing Python and search algorithms.
-   Educators who want simple examples for teaching pathfinding.
-   Developers exploring basic navigation or routing logic.

## High-Level Features

-   Implementation of three pathfinding algorithms: BFS, DFS, and A\*
    Search.
-   Visualization of different route outputs based on algorithm
    behavior.
-   Customizable road map for testing various path scenarios.
-   Use of heuristic-based optimization in A\* for shortest-distance
    pathfinding.
